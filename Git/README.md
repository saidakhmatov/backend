## Why I CS?
Well, from an early age, I was really interested in technology. By technology, I mean mainly pc and phones. I still remember the day when I got my first pc for my birthday present, I was only 6 years old. I used to play it a lot and also there were many cases when I broke it because of my extra curiosity. At that time I enjoyed playing cracked games, installing game modes, and writing cheat codes to games as the majority of people did at my age. But after some time I wanted to learn how it is made and do this kind of stuff myself. Moreover, I enjoyed watching hacking movies, and seeing how someone hacking into another person's pc was seemed really cool to me at that time. After watching more movies and reading about hacking news I  said I would be a  hacker to myself! After analyzing and getting to know that in order to be a good "hacker" one should know programming, I started learning it. I really liked programming and everything seemed easy and very understandable until I started learning c++. 
But as I grew up I understood there is so much you can do with programming not only just hacking and getting someone's private documents. Moreover, the salary of IT-related jobs is quite good and it has a really promising future so I thought why not be a Software developer!? Then in order to be a professional Software developer and study Computer Science more deeply entered to IT university.
